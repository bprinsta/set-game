# Set Game

This app allows you to play the card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">Set</a>, on your iOS Device. The project was initially developed for Stanford's CS193p course (Developing iOS Apps with Swift). I've since added a hint button, confetti animations, and a game rules button to increase the game's playability.
